# Secret Santa Generator
A quick script to randomly generate your family's secret santa givers and recievers. Allows you to add excludes for example if Mum and Dad are already buying each other presents, then you can stop them buying another present in secret santa.  

### Usage
1. Edit `generate.py`, change names in the `givers` array to your family members names. Update `excludes` if you want to stop certain people buying for each other.
2. Run `bash python generate.py` in your terminal. It will print out who is buying for whom.
